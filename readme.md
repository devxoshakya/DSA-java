## Description

In this repository, you will find my solutions to various DSA problems implemented in Java. Each problem is organized in its own directory, with a separate Java file containing the solution code. Additionally, I have included a README file in each directory that explains the problem statement and provides details about the approach and implementation.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle website: [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

## Usage

To run the code for a specific problem, navigate to the corresponding directory and compile the Java file using the `javac` command. Then, execute the compiled class file using the `java` command.
